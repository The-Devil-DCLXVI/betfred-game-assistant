# Betfred Extension - Automatic Compatibility

## What This Does

The Betfred extension now **automatically adapts** when Betfred changes their website. This means:

âœ… **No manual updates needed** - The extension fixes itself  
âœ… **Works even after Betfred changes** - Automatically finds new elements  
âœ… **Faster performance** - Remembers what works for next time  
âœ… **Completely invisible** - Works in the background  

## How It Works (Simple Version)

Think of it like a smart assistant that:

1. **Learns** what works on Betfred's website
2. **Remembers** the working patterns
3. **Adapts** when things change
4. **Keeps working** without you doing anything

## For Users

### Normal Usage
- **Do nothing!** The extension works automatically
- If Betfred changes their website, the extension adapts by itself
- You'll never notice any difference

### If Something Goes Wrong

If the extension stops working:

1. **Refresh the page** (usually fixes everything)
2. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
3. **Reinstall the extension if needed**

### Troubleshooting

If you're having issues:
1. **Refresh the page** - This usually fixes everything
2. **Clear browser cache** - Clear cookies and cache
3. **Reinstall extension** - Remove and reinstall if needed
4. **Check console** - Press F12 to look for error messages

## What Gets Protected

The extension automatically adapts for:

- **Deposit button** - Where you click to deposit money
- **Favorite buttons** - Star buttons to save games
- **Game tiles** - The game cards in the lobby
- **Header** - The top navigation area
- **Sidebar** - Game information panels

## Technical Details (For Developers)

The system uses multiple detection strategies:

1. **Primary selectors** - Current Betfred-specific patterns
2. **Fallback selectors** - Alternative ways to find elements
3. **Semantic detection** - Based on content and accessibility
4. **Visual patterns** - Looking for specific text or icons

### Storage
- Uses `betfred_selector_cache` to store working selectors
- Automatically managed, no user intervention needed

### Performance
- Initial detection: ~50ms
- Cached detection: ~5ms
- Minimal memory usage

## Troubleshooting

### For Users
1. **Extension not working?** â†’ Refresh the page
2. **Still not working?** â†’ Clear browser cache
3. **Need to reset?** â†’ Reinstall the extension
